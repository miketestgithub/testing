## Done
- bem (with flex structure - it would be too long to create folder for every mod and element)
- no bem bundler - just scss (the same reason)
- gulp
- scss
- svg inline to control colors
- mobile first

### Wasn't Done
- no pug/react (this is one page site i think its ok to use reasonable technniques) 
- svg sprites (not a lot of svg)
- bg-image for body is too big - i'd better use some small pattern from online patterns but i've used task materials
